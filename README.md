Programming Contest Judge System is a web applicationthat is developed to evaluate (judge) the algorithmic source code submitted by the users and tests it against various test cases and constraints. It also hosts Competitive Programming Contests as well and produces contest results, which usually called score boards for every contest. Users are also able to practice by submitting any problem after the contest ends. 

 The system can compile and execute code, and test the source code with pre-constructed data. Submitted source code may be run with restrictions, including time limit, memory limit, security restriction and so on. The output of the code will be captured by the system, and compared with the standard output. The system will then return the result. The common results for a specific submissionare:Accepted, Wrong Answer, Time Limit Exceeds, Memory Limit Exceeds, Run Time Error, and Compilation Error.
 
Programming Contest Judge Systemposes problems such as questions in programming contests to users, receives their answers from the users, and checks the correctness of the submitted answers. Checking programs’ correctness implies decision problem of programs’ termination, and therefore it is not been decidable. Thus, the program checking is restricted to an approximation of correctness checking, in which a submitted and the submitted codes are compared with the output data generated by the correct answer programs installed in advance.
